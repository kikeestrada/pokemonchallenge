# Pokemon Challenge Enrique Estrada
Hello! This is the test project you requested as a technical test for the developer position at your company. As initially agreed, I was supposed to develop the functionality to consume a Star Wars API, but since it was not working correctly, we proceeded to carry out the exercise with the Pok√©mon API.

## Points to consider:
- Despite the fact that I made the grid responsive, the main layout that was delivered has issues rendering on mobile devices, but the grid I developed is responsive
- I remain pending on the use of ShadCN Components

Best Regards!
